# Mom-and-Pop POS (SmartVision)

A small Point-of-Sale system for corner shops. It keeps product info, tracks stock, records sales, and shows simple reports—without the complexity or cost of big POS tools.

## What it does
- **Products:** create and edit product details (product code stays fixed)
- **Inventory:** set or adjust quantities; warn when stock is low
- **Sales:** checkout a basket, reduce stock, update revenue; if an item isn’t available, sell the rest and show an error
- **Reports:** view sales in a time range (grouped by customer with a total) and view current inventory (one product or all)
